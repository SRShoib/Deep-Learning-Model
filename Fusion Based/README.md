# Fusion Based CNN Models
Here my customized Fusion Based CNN Models <br> <br/>
<h3>~~Fusion Based~~</h3>
Fusion-based models in CNNs combine the outputs of different convolutional layers or different architectures (like ResNet, MobileNet) to merge feature maps at multiple levels or from different models, improving feature representation and performance (e.g., hybrid models that fuse features from multiple networks like ResNet and DenseNet).
